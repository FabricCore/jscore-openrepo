hi – The Emotional Collapse Simulator

**Description:**

**Are your players too comfortable?** Good. Time to ruin that with **THE MOST POINTLESS COMMAND IN EXISTENCE**:
`/hi`

What does it do? It says **“Hi.”**
That’s it. One word. One period. No context. No follow-up. Just the raw, unfiltered energy of a socially awkward ghost trying to make contact.

This addon is the final straw in your server’s descent into madness. You want feature-rich? Go outside.
You want *meaningless digital eye contact with a pixelated void?* Install this monstrosity.

### FEATURES:

* `/hi` – says **Hi.**
* That’s it.
* No, seriously, that’s the **only** feature.
* It does it *perfectly*.
* We spent 36 sleepless hours optimizing this command for maximum **mediocrity**.

### WHY INSTALL THIS:

* You hate your friends.
* You want to assert dominance by confusing everyone.
* You believe minimalism is an act of rebellion.
* You need therapy but downloaded this instead.

> “I typed /hi and my dog looked at me in disappointment.” – Confused User
> “My server’s vibe has never recovered.” – Server Admin, weeping

**Warning:** This plugin is so lightweight it might achieve sentience out of sheer boredom.
Compatible with all major server versions, your unresolved issues, and the void.
